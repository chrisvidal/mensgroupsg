Tuesday 16th March meeting session log.

Last night, we had our regular Tuesday meetup with 8 powerful and open men.
Every session brings a different taste of what a men's group is. It flows with what the men are presencing together. The quality of their presence makes what will be available.
Last night was the opportunity for them to look at their relationship with women. Men love women, but they are also angry at them, they are heartbroken, they feel hurt by them, they don't trust them, and the list could go on.

The work is first to take responsibility for it, and not deflecting nor blaming out.
It is challenging to hear that but we choose the circumstances of what is happening to and for us.

How you relate to women in your life today is the way you are relating to your own feminine energy. It usually takes root in your childhood through your relationship to your mother or
feminine figure in your cate takers.

How do you relate to your own emotions? to your own unpredictability? to your creativity?

Some amazing visceral work has been possible last night thanks to the trust and presence of these men ready for it.

Do the work.

Thanks for showing up men!
