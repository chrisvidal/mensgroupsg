In today's day and age, it's very easy to distract ourselves from our problems, especially if we lack deeper social or emotional support from our peers and family. It's hard to find a place where we can discuss those problems openly, without fear of judgement and receive precious opinions derived from other life experiences.

In Mens Group SG I found exactly that, a group of men who not only listened to me but allowed me to see my problems for what they were as well as destress and realize, we all go through sh*t sometimes.

I advise every man to try it at least once and find the same place of growth and sense of community I found at the Men's Group Singapore.
