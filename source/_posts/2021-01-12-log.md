Tuesday 12th Jan meeting session log.

A powerful intentional burning-ceremony took the men very deep emotionally. Their acknowledging of sufferings and weaknesses in front of other men were more than inspiring for each other. The safety and sacred character of the ritual allowed more space for intensity in the sharing.

Different background, different childhood, different challenges.
But same compassion, same strength, same resilience, same determination to look forward and upward!

We also enjoyed a nice King's cake at the end of the meeting :)

Thanks all for showing up and looking forward to next week! ðŸ‘Š
