Tonight's topic during the men's group was all about self-care.

What is it? And how do you take care of yourself?

Self-care is attending to your core needs, not talking about basic survival needs, but more about how you feel love(d), peace and alive.
Great insights can be found in the 5 languages of love. Go check it out if you don't know about them.

One important aspect to understand is the difference between self-indulgence and self-care.

The former is acted from the ego, satisfying the sense of me and exacerbating a sense of separateness through addictive numbness. Self-indulgence is all about the little me.
Self-care means that we know and attend to our core-needs, for as it means self-love. Genuine self-care will lead to self-love.
If we don't take care of ourselves first, we will never be able to really take care of others, at least not for long. If you are burnout, restless, sick, or resentful, there is no way you can take care of anyone for long.

We need to rest and replenish physically, emotionally, and spiritually as per our core-needs.

Thank you all for showing up! üôèüëä
