A No-Ejaculation Challenge is currently happening for some of the men in the group. Five of them to be precise.

Not only it is a courageous endeavor to take on, but it is also a way of living a life by questioning the "norms" (often dictated by society and culture) and finding the answers (our own Truth) through our own experiences.

Boys follow trends and mass. Men follow their inner-compass.

Who the fuck on earth said that you have to masturbate and ejaculate every day as a man?
Oh yeah, instant gratification, isn't it?
Oh yeah, quick tiny pleasure and release of 3 sec, isn't it?

Unfortunately, this is a serious business that we are talking about.

Non-Intentional ejaculation is simply killing men, day after day. Sperm after sperm.

Just give it a try, 7 days to start with, and expands to 14 maybe, and experience what it is to keep your life-force in you, which is literally the creative energy that you could use to build a better world.

You will experience what means clarity,
You will overflow with energy and ideas,
You will be more present,
You will be more sensitive to women and life energy,
You will experience greater intimacy with your partner,
You will experience much greater sex with your partner,
You will feel more powerful and in charge of your life instead of being a slave to your addictives compulsions.

Just saying...don't take my words for granted, just do it and see for yourself.
