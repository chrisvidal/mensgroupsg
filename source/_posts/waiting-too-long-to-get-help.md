One of the common and biggest mistake that men do is too wait too long to ask for help.

I've seen that in myself for years.
Are you the type of guys who will not ask his direction to someone when you are lost in a city?
I was for a long time. It is quite symptomatic of something that is going on deeper.

Where does this stem from? What is going on there?
Some lone wolf attitude mixed with shame to look weak are very often running the show.
Sentences like "I got to do it myself" or "I will look like a pussy if I ask for help" are unfortunately too common in the world of men.
