As I was practicing ```doing nothing``` as taught by my teacher [John Wineland](http://www.johnwineland.com), the word "humility" down fall from above my head, after 2 long hours sitting there. Doing nothing isn't easy at all, but this will be the opportunity for a future article. Here, I'd like to talk about humility.

What is in that quality that feels so important?

Humility isn't easy. It requires us to recognize and accept our faults and weaknesses.

It reminds me all the great inspiring men that I have the fortune to met during my lifetime. They all embody the aspect of humility.

As I was sharing with a man from the men's group over a cup of coffee last week, all the great men I met in real life share this similar quality of being transparent, unhidden. They don't hide anything. From themself first. From others then become natural and easy as they already owned most of the flwas and qualities of themselves. It is a direct perceivable experience in being in their presence. It creates a massive sense of trust. Trust of being seen and accepted as you are, for as there is nothing they didn't see before seeing me.
From this trust is a emerging simple and real opening.

We can also see that humility owns something similar to apologizing.
You have to own it and process it openly to be able to bring it all up again.
Both requires a level of vulnerability, authenticity and a non-judgmental approach.

“Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness.” — Brene Brown

What comes in the way of humility?
Pride
Embarassment
