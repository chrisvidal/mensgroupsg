As I was practicing ```doing nothing``` as taught by my teacher [John Wineland](http://www.johnwineland.com), the word "humility" down fall from above my head, after 2 long hours sitting there. Doing nothing isn't easy at all, but this will be the opportunity for a future article. Here, I'd like to talk about humility.

What is in that quality that feels so important?

Humility isn't easy. It requires us to recognize and accept our faults and weaknesses.

It reminds me the great inspiring men that I've the fortune to met during my lifetime, [blabla which was all founded by my generous partner]

As I was sharing with a man from the men's group over a cup of coffee last week, all the great men I met in real life share this similar quality of being transparent. They don't hide anything. From themself first. From others as well. It is a direct perceivable experience in being in their presence. It creates a massive sense of trust. Trust of being seen and accepted as I was, for as there is nothing they didn't see before seeing me.
From this trust is flowing opening.
