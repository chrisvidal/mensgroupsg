As I was practicing ```doing nothing``` as taught by my teacher [John Wineland](http://www.johnwineland.com), the word "humility" down fall from above my head, after 2 long hours sitting there. Doing nothing isn't easy at all, but this will be the opportunity for a future article. Here, I'd like to talk about humility.

What is in that quality that feels so important?

Humility isn't easy. It requires us to recognize and accept our faults and weaknesses.

It reminds me the great inspiring men that I've the fortune to met during my lifetime, [blabla which was all founded by my generous partner]

As I was sharing with a man from the men's group over a cup of coffee last week, all the great men I met in real life share this similar quality of being transparent. They don't hide anything. From themself first. From others as well. It is a direct perceivable experience in being in their presence. It creates a massive sense of trust. Trust of being seen and accepted as I was, for as there is nothing they didn't see before seeing me.
From this trust is flowing opening.

Humility owns something similar to apologizing.
You have to own it and process it openly to be able to bring it all up again.
Both requires a level of vulnerability.

“Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness.” — Brene Brown

What comes in the way of humility?
Pride
Embarassment
