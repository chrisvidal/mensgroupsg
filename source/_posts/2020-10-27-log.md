Another great evening of connection and conversation tonight during which we talked about how to shift a victim standpoint to an empowered perspective by asking a better question.

We had the opportunity to engage the discussion on the external pressure from society/work/parent felt by men to be more productive again and again. Which brought us to the simple question of how to enjoy life with more simple purposeless attitude and acts.

Thank you all for showing up! 🙏👊
