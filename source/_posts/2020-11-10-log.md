The last evening meeting was full of reminders for us.

One of the many intentions of participating in a men's group lives in the opportunity of deep practices. The most obvious lies in bringing your full presence to the meeting. How much distracted are you by the external world or your internal world?

During the call, or with your partner in life, men require your full attention for the integrity of the container. They need to know that you are here with them, actively listening, creating a human connection.

Otherwise, men might call you out if you are not fully present with them, which is a good loving reminder that lifts men up to higher potential.

Thanks all for showing up last night! ðŸ‘Š
