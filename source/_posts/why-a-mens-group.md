The modern world is made in a way that requires you to thrive if you want to consider your life successful. But our brain is build for surviving, not for thriving.

This means you need to effectively deal with psychological, emotional and mental challenges all day long. Men often think they have to do it on their own, the Lone Wolf syndrome.

At work, you need to be creative and productive on demand — regardless of how you feel. This means regulating your emotions in real-time because the next task, the next client, [...fill in the blank...] is already waiting. Meanwhile, there’s stuff going on in your personal life. To come across as someone who “has it together,” you also need to keep that in check. Men are not really well equipped for this regulation, for many cultural and societal reasons.

Handling your feelings while maintaining steady performance over the high expectations isn’t an easy task. A lot of men lack adequate support from others when comes to their emotional life. This can make emotion regulation seem like an impossible challenge for men who just don't know how to talk about it and have no safe enough space to entrust. So they repress, they dissociate, they react, they deny, they project onto others, they rationalise.

This is where the power of men's group comes in.
