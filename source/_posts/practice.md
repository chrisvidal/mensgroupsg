Our modern life is getting busier and busier. Everyone, especially marketing companies, are fighthing for our attention nad are bombarding us with never ending messages. But also, family and friends.

People are taking less and less time for themselves than few decades ago.

As a famous Zen proverb goes:
"If you don'thave time to meditate 20 min,
you should meditate one hour."

What does this mean? Wjhat is the message behing the scene?
