What it means to be a man today?

Such a long conversation to have with ourselves and other men. That is why the Men’s Group Singapore exists in the first place.
A man is first and foremost connected to himself, he is in connection to nature, to the feminine and to other men.

This event is offered as an invitation into an experience. It’s an invitation to open a doorway and enter Men’s work. This work isn’t about “easy”, “good” and “cool”. It’s not about happiness, appearances, performance and money.
It’s about being authentic, growing up emotionally, connecting to yourself and reclaiming integrity.
It’s not about feeling good either, it is about becoming good at feeling.

It’s about getting attuned to our own body and consciousness through practices and becoming a Warrior of the Heart.

This 4 hours workshop, exclusively for men above age of 21, is designed to be a challenging experience between men. It is designed to expand self-awareness and connection through a set of practices and discussion. A 5th hour for those who desires so, will be spend in the nature in silence.

Physical practices, mental practices, energetical practices, sharing practices, pair and group practices seasoned with discussions, Q&A and surprises.
