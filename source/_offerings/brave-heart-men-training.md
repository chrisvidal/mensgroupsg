The Brave Heart Men Training is a unique 9 weeks program, a transformational program for men willing to take responsibility and leadership for their life.

We are starting our second run of the men's training program end of January 2021!

This intensive program running for 9 weeks is for dedicated men willing to grow through a guided self-discovery journey, supported and challenged by like-minded men. The program holds the necessary structure, content, and practices to support your growth in the multi-facets of your masculinity.

A man's feedback from the 1st run says it all:
> "Seeking growth as a man and to have someone point me in the right direction towards becoming a man. Initially, it wasn't so much the group as I was hesitant, but it turns out that the interaction with the group was what kept me growing!"

There are only 6 seats left, website and applications for registration are now open here https://braveheartmen.training
