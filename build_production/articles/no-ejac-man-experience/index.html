                    <p>A recent break-up left me in a state of pain, regret and soul-searching. To facilitate healing I tried several different self-improvement methods, one of which was to attend Men’s Group Singapore. I’d heard of such groups before but had no idea what to expect. I joined my first session unsure of what was involved, and somewhat intimidated by the concept of sitting in a circle with men I had never met before. But my anxieties subsided quickly, and after 2 hours I left feeling reborn. When men get together in a spirit of maturity and openness, great things happen.</p>
<p>The focus of this article, however, is not the group itself but a practice I discovered there called semen retention. In everyday language this means “not ejaculating”, and followers are earnest about its many touted benefits, including presence, energy, mental clarity, masculinity, better sex, and improved connection with others. Christophe the group leader is himself a strong believer, and visibly embodies masculinity, presence and stillness. When he proposed a 3-week no-ejaculation challenge to the group I thought “why not?”</p>
<p>For the first week or so I experienced a fair amount of frustration. Having been in the habit of jerking off most nights before sleep (usually with porn) my immediate reaction was one of mild irritation at not being allowed my usual bedtime ritual. We are creatures of habit, and bedtime without self-pleasure was to me a bit like mornings without coffee (coincidentally, something I’m also currently working on).</p>
<p>Without recourse to my usual pressure release, I become more and more horny over the next few days. There were periods when I was so aroused my whole body felt like an erect penis. But after 7-10 days it settled again and I more or less stopped thinking about sex for the remainder of the period. I wondered if my sexuality had shrunk into a dormant state and would take a while to find its feet again.</p>
<p>This wasn’t completely unfounded: it took another couple of weeks for my libido to reach full steam. But awaking the slumbering beast was very enjoyable. I did so with a different approach: unhurried, present, and savouring all the sensations. An occasion, rather than a mindless bedtime ritual.</p>
<p>So what benefits did I notice? My inner scientist is quick to point out that this was a very small, “n=1” experiment, with many other variables at play, including the rollercoaster of post-breakup emotions and my other self-improvement efforts. So it’s impossible to know how much to credit to semen retention. However, over the 3 weeks I did experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>improved connection: looking at people in the eye and listening properly</li>
<li>an increased presence and enjoyment with other daily activities</li>
<li>more energy and focus</li>
<li>a more open, confident posture</li>
<li>improved self-esteem</li>
<li>more pleasurable sex and masturbation on my return</li>
<li>lasting freedom from my bedtime porn ritual</li>
</ul>
<p>There is some instinctive sense to this practice. While orgasm often delivers great pleasure and satisfaction, there is an accompanying “deflation” that often manifests as sleepiness. It’s not without reason that the French term the phenomenon petite mort, or “little death”.</p>
<p>Powerful hormonal changes occur immediately after ejaculation that cause a shift in mood. One of the main players is prolactin, which rises sharply in the immediate post-orgasmic period and leads to a temporary reduction in libido, loss of ejaculatory capacity, and sleepiness. Prolactin also inhibits dopamine, a key driver of the male libido. Abstinence has also been shown to increase blood testosterone levels (albeit peaking at 7 days before declining to baseline), and to increase the density of brain androgen receptors in rats. From my amateur internet trawl, there are no conclusive studies on the benefits of semen retention (largely because there are no studies period), but clearly things do happen at a biochemical level.</p>
<p>Conclusions? Abstinence from ejaculation, and certainly from cheap, pre-bedtime masturbation sessions, probably improved my self esteem, presence and wellbeing. I’ll be trying fasts like this again in the future. There is no doubt that on a psychological level, being in control of one’s body and urges rather than the other way round is a satisfying and empowering thing. But I also gained new appreciation of the sacredness of this most powerful of human appetites. Sex elevates life, and as such is worthy of great respect. Enjoying sex in all its forms is a bit like enjoying wine. In moderate quantities, sipped and savoured, while appreciating the colour and bouquet, it imparts magic to life. Large swigs directly from the bottle cannot deliver this, and too much of it can make you ill. While you’re at it, why not apply this philosophy to all of life’s experiences? Be it food, relationships, alone time or work life, we can savour and celebrate it all.</p>                </div>
